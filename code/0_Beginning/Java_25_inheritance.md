public inheritance in java

In Java, the concept of public inheritance works similarly to other object-oriented languages like C++, with some differences in syntax and rules. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword, and it supports public inheritance by default for the public and protected members of the base class.

Public Inheritance in Java
When a class inherits from another class publicly, it means that:

Public members of the base class become public members of the derived class, accessible to any code outside the derived class.
Protected members of the base class remain protected in the derived class, accessible only within the derived class and its subclasses.
Private members are not inherited and cannot be directly accessed by the derived class.
Example in Java:
java
Copy code
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // Public inheritance using 'extends'
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal class
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog class
    }
}
Key Points:
The Dog class inherits from the Animal class using extends. The method eat() is inherited and accessible in Dog.
Public inheritance in Java means the subclass can access the public methods of the parent class, and the class follows an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a Dog is an Animal).
Important Considerations:
Java supports single inheritance (a class can inherit from only one superclass).
The subclass cannot inherit the private members of the superclass, but it can access them indirectly through getter and setter methods if they are provided.

In Java, the access control of members (fields and methods) is managed through access modifiers: private, protected, default (package-private), and public. When a class inherits from another class, the inheritance behavior for these access levels is different. Let's explore the examples for private, protected, and default inheritance.

1. Private Inheritance
In Java, private members are not inherited by the subclass. They are inaccessible to subclasses, meaning the derived class cannot directly access them.

Example:

java
Copy code
class Animal {
    private void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
    
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // Public inheritance
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
    }

    public void testEat() {
        // Cannot access eat() here because it's private in the parent class
        // eat();  // This would cause a compilation error
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.bark();
        dog.sleep();  // This works as sleep() is public
    }
}
Output:

csharp
Copy code
Dog is barking.
Animal is sleeping.
The eat() method is private in the Animal class, so it is not inherited by the Dog class.
The sleep() method is public, so it is inherited and can be used in the Dog class.
2. Protected Inheritance
The protected members of a class are inherited by the subclass, and they can be accessed in the subclass. However, protected members are still not accessible outside the subclass or class hierarchy.

Example:

java
Copy code
class Animal {
    protected void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // Public inheritance
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
    }

    public void testEat() {
        // Can access protected method here
        eat();  // This works because eat() is protected
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.bark();
        dog.testEat();  // This works as testEat() calls the protected eat() method
    }
}
Output:

csharp
Copy code
Dog is barking.
Animal is eating.
The eat() method is protected in the Animal class, so it is inherited and accessible in the Dog class.
The testEat() method demonstrates that the protected method is accessible within the subclass.
3. Default (Package-Private) Inheritance
When a member is package-private (i.e., no access modifier is specified), it is accessible to other classes in the same package but not outside of it. In inheritance, default members are inherited by subclasses within the same package, but not by subclasses outside the package.

Example:

java
Copy code
class Animal {
    void eat() {  // Default (package-private) access
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // Public inheritance
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
    }

    public void testEat() {
        // Can access eat() here as Dog is in the same package as Animal
        eat();  // This works because eat() is default (package-private)
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.bark();
        dog.testEat();  // This works as testEat() calls the default eat() method
    }
}
Output:

csharp
Copy code
Dog is barking.
Animal is eating.
The eat() method has default (package-private) access, so it is inherited by the Dog class because both Dog and Animal are in the same package.
If Dog was in a different package, it would not be able to access eat() directly.
Summary of Inheritance Behavior in Java:
Private members are not inherited by the subclass and cannot be accessed directly.
Protected members are inherited and can be accessed in the subclass, but not outside the class hierarchy.
Default (package-private) members are inherited if the subclass is in the same package; otherwise, they cannot be accessed outside the package.
