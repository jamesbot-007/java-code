## Collection framework
Collection framework is represents group of objects
collection provide class and interface that we can use to save time and increase productiviy, efficiency.

already stored 100 students and then storing 1 more student is hard. because it requires create new array and copy all elements from old array to new array. it is very time consuming. Instead of that we use collection framework a pre-written code
Framework: We need to follow protocol to to make something happen. Full abstraction.


why do we need collection ?
for better efficient memory usage
resize array ? shifting element after insert/delete element.

Collection framework's class will handle all these things we do not need to write code for those things each time.
save time and focus on other things like database connection, etc ...


Few commonly used collections 
ArrayList: create array of variable(int, object, etc..), 
Stack: follow LIFO 
Set: store unique data values  
HashMap: stored data in form of key-value pair

It is present in java.util.Collection; class.



## Collection class hierarchy
this picture shows what is what ? interface, concrete class, abstract class !
interface can be implemented or extended by other interface

java.util.Collection is actully an interface not a class.



## How to use Java Documentations / learn to read Java Documentations
java version_no docs > API documentation > java.base > java.util 

we can create documentation of out own package automatically that feature is also provided by java.
