/* Compiler vs Interpreater
 * 
 * Interpreter execute the code line by line Compiler execute code in once
 * Interpreter not creates a machine code whereas Compiler creates 
 * 
 * Machine code is something that runs on a particular architecture. It is platform dependent. Machine code is Different on Windows, Mac and linux.
 * Once we compile to the class file then we can run the .class file how many times we want
 * Once you compile the code using compiler and you delete compiler still code can be run
Example : c program .exe file
 * Whereas, Interpreter needed interpreater every time without it we can't run the program 
 * When one error in line no. 100 then in code. compiler will not execute whereas interpreter executes line 1 to 99 and at line 100 you get error
 * 
 * 
 * Compiler languages like C are hard to learn but fast .
Interpreter languages like python, javascript easy to learn but slow.

 /* Java is a compiler and interpreter language. Java is hybrid language and it uses both compilation and interpretation.
  * 
  * Java is hybrid language use compiler and interpreter both This just because to make java platform independent

  * Means we can compile code on your platform using javac compiler . That gives the class file ( byte code) that byte code is platform independent means it can run on any platform that work is done by JVM. The java will interpret using java interpreter 
  * 
  * Because of that java known as “write once run everywhere”.
