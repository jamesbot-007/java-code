# JDK Tools

The Java Development Kit (JDK) comes with several built-in tools to help developers compile, debug, document, and manage Java programs. Here's a list of the major tools included in the JDK:

---

### **1. Compilation and Execution Tools**

- **`javac`**: The Java compiler. Converts Java source code (`.java`) into bytecode (`.class`).
- **`java`**: The Java application launcher. Executes Java bytecode programs.
- **`jshell`**: An interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool for experimenting with Java code.

---

### **2. Documentation Tools**

- **`javadoc`**: Generates API documentation in HTML format from Java source code.
- **`javap`**: The Java class file disassembler. Displays detailed information about compiled `.class` files.

---

### **3. Debugging Tools**

- **`jdb`**: The Java debugger. Allows debugging of Java programs, such as setting breakpoints and inspecting variables.
- **`jstack`**: Prints Java thread stack traces to analyze program state or diagnose deadlocks.
- **`jmap`**: Generates memory maps of running Java programs for analyzing heap memory usage.
- **`jhat`**: The Java Heap Analysis Tool (deprecated but still usable with older JDKs). Used to analyze heap dump files.
- **`jhsdb`**: Java HotSpot Debugger, a tool to inspect and debug Java processes.

---

### **4. Monitoring and Profiling Tools**

- **`jconsole`**: A graphical monitoring tool to observe Java applications' performance and resource consumption.
- **`jps`**: Lists all Java processes running on the system.
- **`jstat`**: Monitors Java Virtual Machine (JVM) statistics, such as garbage collection and memory usage.
- **`jstatd`**: Starts a daemon for monitoring JVMs on a remote system.
- **`jinfo`**: Displays configuration information for a running Java process.
- **`jcmd`**: Sends diagnostic command requests to JVMs. A powerful, all-in-one utility for JVM diagnostics.

---

### **5. Packaging and Deployment Tools**

- **`jar`**: Creates and manages Java Archive (`.jar`) files.
- **`jlink`**: Generates custom runtime images containing only the required modules.
- **`jmod`**: Creates and manages Java Module (`.jmod`) files.
- **`jdeps`**: Analyzes dependencies of Java class files to identify module and package dependencies.

---

### **6. Security Tools**

- **`keytool`**: Manages keystores and certificates.
- **`jarsigner`**: Signs and verifies `.jar` files to ensure code integrity and authenticity.
- **`policytool`**: A GUI-based tool for managing security policy files.

---

### **7. Internationalization Tools**

- **`native2ascii`**: Converts text files from non-ASCII encoding to ASCII with Unicode escapes, useful for localization.

---

### **8. Advanced Tools**

- **`jdeprscan`**: Scans for usage of deprecated APIs in a Java program.
- **`javapackager`** (deprecated in recent JDKs): Used for packaging Java applications.
- **`jimage`**: Examines and extracts files from `.jimage` files in the JDK.

---

### **9. JavaFX Tools**

If you're using JavaFX (a library for GUI development), some additional tools like `jfxpackager` or JavaFX-specific APIs may be included with older versions of the JDK.

---

### **10. Compiler Tools**

- **`javac`**: The primary Java compiler.
- **`jcmd`**: Often used for compiler-related diagnostic commands.

---

### **11. Utilities for JVM**

- **`javaw`**: Launches Java programs in the background without a console window (Windows-specific).
- **`rmic`**: Generates stub and skeleton class files for remote objects (used in RMI).
- **`rmiregistry`**: Starts the RMI registry service.
- **`serialver`**: Returns the serialVersionUID of a class for serialization.
